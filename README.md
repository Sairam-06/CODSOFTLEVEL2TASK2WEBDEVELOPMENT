# CODSOFTLEVEL2TASK2WEBDEVELOPMENT
Building a job board website involves both front-end and back-end development. Below is a basic outline using React for the front end and Node.js for the back end, along with MongoDB as the database. This is just a starting point, and you may need to expand on this depending on your specific requirements.Frontend (React):
Install Create React App:npx create-react-app job-board
cd job-board
Dependencies:
Install necessary packages:npm install react-router-dom axios
Create Components:

Home Page (HomePage.js)
Job Listings Page (JobListingsPage.js)
Job Detail Page (JobDetailPage.js)
Employer Dashboard (EmployerDashboard.js)
Candidate Dashboard (CandidateDashboard.js)
Job Application Form (JobApplicationForm.js)
Routing:
Set up routing in App.js using react-router-dom to navigate between different pages.

API Calls:
Use axios to make API calls to the backend for retrieving job listings, job details, submitting job applications, etc.
Backend (Node.js with Express and MongoDB):
Initialize Node.js Project:mkdir job-board-backend
cd job-board-backend
npm init -y
Dependencies:
Install necessary packages:npm install express mongoose nodemailer bcrypt cors
Server Setup (server.js):

Configure Express server.
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Set up routes for handling job listings, job applications, user authentication, etc.
User Authentication:

Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Hash and salt passwords using bcrypt.
Database Models:
Define MongoDB models for Users, Jobs, and Applications.

Email Notifications:
Use nodemailer to send email notifications for successful applications and updates.

Security:
Implement security measures, such as CORS headers, secure password handling, and JWT for authentication.

Integration:
Connect Frontend to Backend:
Update API calls in the React components to interact with the backend.

Mobile Responsiveness:
Ensure your React components are responsive. You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or implement media queries.

Running the Application:
Start Backend Server:node server.js
Start React App:
In the job-board directory:npm start
This is a basic setup. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to add features such as user roles, additional user details, more sophisticated job application forms, and advanced search functionality. Additionally, remember to handle errors and edge cases appropriately throughout the application.
